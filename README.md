# Tree Cover Simulation and Visualization

This project simulates the dynamics of tree cover in response to varying rainfall rates and visualizes the results.

## Files

- `model.py`: Contains the simulation models that compute tree cover over time under different rainfall conditions.
- `plot.py`: Contains functions for visualizing the simulation results through various plots and heatmaps.
## Running the Project

To start the simulation and generate visualizations, simply run the `plot.py` script:

```shell
python plot.py
```
This will automatically run the tree cover simulation models and generate visualizations, which include:

- Heatmaps representing the temporal evolution of tree cover under different rainfall conditions.
- 3D scatter plots showing the final tree cover in relation to initial tree cover and rainfall rates.
- Line plots depicting the rate of change of tree cover across a range of rainfall rates.
